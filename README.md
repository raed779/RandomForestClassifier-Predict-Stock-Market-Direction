# RandomForestClassifier-Predict-Stock-Market-Direction

A Forest Classifier is an approach to minimize the heavy bias a Decision Tree can get. A forest classifier simply contains a set of decision trees and uses majority voting to make the prediction.

In this tutorial we will try to use that on the stock market, by creating a few indicators. This tutorial will give a framework to explore if it can predict the direction of a stock. Given a set of indicators, will the stock go up or down the next trading day.

This is a simplified problem of predicting the actual stock value the next day.
